## Post-Install Recommendation

After macOS installation completed please do some of my recommendation

### Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didnâ€™t.

command : 
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Disable Apple Gatekeeper
Gatekeeper is a new security feature starting in Mac OS 10.8. See [Apple's Website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) for more information about Gatekeeper features and benefits. \
 \
how-to : 
```
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General
```

### Disable .DS_store
Hate .DS_store file showing in your project file?

command :
```
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
```

### Install oh-my-zsh
Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. \
 \
command : 
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
